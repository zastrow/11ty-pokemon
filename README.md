This is a quick experiment to try out [11ty](http://11ty.dev) paired with the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co). I was able to set this up within 15 minutes.

You’ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed for this project then in the repo directory run the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` in a terminal window
2. Once done, run `npm start` which will output the server URL
3. Open the server URL in your web browser of choice

Enjoy, and I hope you find this short demo useful.
